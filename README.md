# free_exam_pastpaper_download
`#__author__=="0han"`

This script program is for high school students who's also in IB program to download free past exam papers directly from the website:
https://freeexampapers.com
As you can see in the index page, they've collected lots of past papers from different programs in the world, and this script focuses on IB, you can fix it for ur own thing

This Script is written by Python3, and you need the libs--"beautifulsoup4" and "requests" with `pip3 install` before you use it. The only thing you need to do is type the subject name like "english" and the link of the page. **This is important** the link of the page you input should looks like a list of folders which is named after the years, for example,this link (https://freeexampapers.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=101&jsmallfib=1&dir=JSROOT/IB/English/English-B/Standard)
Then the script will start creating the folder with named after year automatically, also download the pdf file which is the most important papers you want.

According to the website path, there are some pdf file is empty and will also be downloaded, I can't make the program verify if the file is empty. Sorry for that and if you have idea, please send email to **0han@protonmail.com** let me know, thanks for your help.

This is the version v1.0.0
I will add some new function like muti-processing to improve the download speed if I have time. 
Thank you for using my project.
